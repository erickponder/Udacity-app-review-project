DESCRIPTION:
Restaurant Review App

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
- Extract the zip file into any folder

- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

- In any terminal (like command prompt for windows), check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

- Once server is running, open your browser and type in http://localhost:8000

*As of python 3.7.2 python -m http.server  works, seems like python3 may not work
